## Description
The course was intended to introduce students to the fundamental mathematical concepts required for a program in data science. As a TA, I had to conduct exam and evaluate them.

## Course Content
The following topics was covered, but not
necessarily in the order listed below:
1. Vector spaces
2. Linear equations
3. Orthogonality
4. Eigen values and vectors
5. Basics of Probability
6. Discrete and continuous random variables
7. Joint, marginals and conditionals
8. Multivariate Normal
9. Laws of large numbers and central limit theorem
10. Unconstrained and constrained optimisation
11. Gradient methods for unconstrained optimisation
12. Theory of Lagrangians for constrained optimisation.
13. Algorithms for constrained optimisation.
14. Applications of Linear algebra, Probability and Optimisation in data science: Random projections, Principal component analysis.
